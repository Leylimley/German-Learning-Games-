# German Learning Game

A command-line educational game built in C that helps users learn advanced German vocabulary (B1-C2 levels) through multiple-choice questions.

## Learning Objectives
- Implementation of basic game mechanics in C
- Working with structures (structs)
- Dynamic memory management
- User input handling
- Multiple choice logic implementation
- Basic game state management

## Features
- 20 common German words from B1-C2 levels
- Multiple choice questions
- Difficulty level indicators
- Score tracking system
- Health/lives system
- Clear screen functionality for better UX

## Technical Concepts Demonstrated
- Arrays and Structures in C
- Random number generation
- Input/Output operations
- Control flow
- Basic game loop implementation
- Cross-platform compatibility

## How to Compile and Run

- GCC compiler
- Make (optional)

### Using GCC
```bash
gcc german_game.c -o german_game
./german_game
```

### Using Make
